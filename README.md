# **PreyToLive-AllOpenZones v1.0.5:**

Developed by: [NEWBR33D](https://github.com/NEWBR33D) (aka [PreyToLive](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/user/24548-preytolive/))

AllOpenZones is a mod that will make PMCs and Scavs spawn in any open zone on any map. These zones include cultists spawns, boss spawns, raider spawns, rogue spawns, etc.

#### ***DISCLAIMER:***
This mod does NOT add new bot spawns and does NOT increase/decrease the amount (or rate) of bots that spawn.

## **Overview:**
After some testing, I have been able to locate the spawn locations for all the open zones included for PMCs/Scavs. I referenced all the open zones from maps on the Tarkov wiki.

Factory and Interchange do not have any additional open zones to include for PMCs/Scavs.
